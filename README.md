House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
This repository contains an analysis for the Kaggle competition House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques, performed by Zaeem Sabir as part of the coursework for MS Data Science (Roll No: 2024-MS-DS-136).

Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the sale prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, using advanced regression techniques. The dataset includes 79 features describing various aspects of homes.

Workflow Overview
Data Exploration

Conducted an initial analysis to understand data characteristics, trends, and outliers.
Addressed missing data using imputation techniques or feature removal.
Feature Engineering

Selected the most relevant features for predicting house prices.
Transformed categorical variables, scaled numerical features, and engineered new features.
Modeling

Explored and implemented multiple regression models, including linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosting techniques.
Trained models using techniques like train-test split and cross-validation.
Model Evaluation

Assessed model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Compared different models to identify the best-performing one.
Results
The project evaluates various regression models and identifies key insights related to predicting house prices.
Recommendations for future work include exploring additional features and advanced modeling techniques.
